#General Guidelines
When writing a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), remember to do the following:

- Use plain English.  Write so the public can clearly understand what the system does.  Avoid overly technical / jargon-filled language, and spell out any acronyms you use.
- Be detailed.  Include enough detail so the risks and mitigations of the system can be understood and reviewed.  Remember that the Privacy Office will need to be able to assess enough information from the document to make an educated determination.
- Complete the entire form.  Explain in detail the answers any questions you believe aren't applicable to your system. Doing so will help you avoid delays.
- If legal or other references apply, cite them.  If this information will help the public and / or the Privacy Office better understand what the system does, include the relevant information.
- Double-check your work.  Check for any spelling / grammatical errors before submitting the PIA.  Make sure any technical terms are spelled out and adequately explained.
