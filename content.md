# Introduction  
The Department of the Interior requires PIAs to be conducted and maintained on all IT systems whether already in existence, in development or undergoing modification in order to adequately evaluate privacy risks, ensure the protection of privacy information, and consider privacy implications throughout the information system development life cycle.  

Need more guidance?  The [DOI PIA Guide](https://www.doi.gov/sites/doi.gov/files/migrated/ocio/information_assurance/privacy/upload/DOI-PIA-Guide-09-30-2014.pdf) provides more in-depth information on when and why PIAs are required, legal references and guidelines for filling out this template.  You can also email the [Departmental Privacy Office](mailto:DOI_Privacy@ios.doi.gov) for more help.

## Is the system using technologies in ways that the DOI has not previously employed (e.g., monitoring software, SmartCards or Caller ID)?
## Will this system provide the capability to identify, locate and monitor individuals?
## What kinds of information are collected as a function of the monitoring of individuals?
## What controls are in place to prevent the misuse (e.g., browsing) of data by those having access?
## How will the PII be secured?
## Who will be responsible for protecting the privacy rights of the individuals whose PII is collected, maintained, or shared on the system?  Have policies and/or procedures been established for this responsibility and accountability?   This includes officials responsible for addressing Privacy Act complaints and requests for redress or amendment of records.
