#Introduction
The Department of the Interior requires PIAs to be conducted and maintained on all IT systems whether already in existence, in development or undergoing modification in order to adequately evaluate privacy risks, ensure the protection of privacy information, and consider privacy implications throughout the information system development life cycle.  

Need more guidance?  The [DOI PIA Guide] provides more in-depth information on when and why PIAs are required, legal references and guidelines for filling out this template.  You can also contact DOI's privacy office:

##How will the information be collected?  
##What is the intended use of the PII collected?
##With whom will the PII be shared, both within DOI and outside DOI?  
##What information is provided to an individual when asked to provide PII data?

##Is the PII current?  How is this determined? 
##What are the retention periods of PII for this system?  Under what guidelines are the retention periods determined?  Who establishes the retention guidelines?  
##What are the procedures for disposition of the PII at the end of the retention period?  How long will any reports that contain PII be maintained?  How is the information disposed (e.g., shredding, degaussing, overwriting, etc.)?  Who establishes the decommissioning procedures?  
##Briefly describe privacy risks and information handling practices at each stage of the “information lifecycle” (i.e., collection, use, retention, processing, disclosure and destruction) affect individual privacy.

#PII Safeguards and Liabilities

Have policies and/or procedures been established for this responsibility and accountability?   This includes officials responsible for addressing Privacy Act complaints and requests for redress or amendment of records.
##Who is responsible for assuring safeguards for the PII?  Who is responsible for reporting the loss, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, or unauthorized access of privacy protected information?
