##How will the new data be verified for relevance and accuracy?
##Are the data or the processes being consolidated?
##Who will have access to data in the system or electronic collection?  
##How is user access to data determined?  Will users have access to all data or will access be restricted?
##Are contractors involved with the design and/or development of the system, or will they be involved with the maintenance of the system?
##Is the system using technologies in ways that the DOI has not previously employed (e.g., monitoring software, SmartCards or Caller ID)?
##Will this system provide the capability to identify, locate and monitor individuals?
##What kinds of information are collected as a function of the monitoring of individuals?
##What controls will be used to prevent unauthorized monitoring?
##How will the PII be secured?
